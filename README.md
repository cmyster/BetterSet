# Better Set

This is a personal educational project and it is not trying to solve any problem.

This program is taking in list of sets of numbers and is trying to find a pattern.

The distance and closeness between the sets is measured and the machine is trying
to find a group of sets that is a bit off.

When those groups of sets are identified, the program will try to guess a new set
that will fit well with the last "bit off" group.
